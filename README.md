=================

python monte carlo simulator for the returns in Simba's bogleheads spreadsheet

The spreadsheet can be downloaded here:

for reference:

I took the data from the "Data_72_13" tab in the spreadsheet. The goal is to create a python script that assists in allocation discovery.

The current script finds the first portfolio with lower than 7 std deviation.
